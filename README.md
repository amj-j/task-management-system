# Task Management System Web App

This app is a project that I built to practice my Spring boot and webapp development skills. It doesn't serve any real life purpose.

I tried to implement Spring security, but I wasn't able to find any tutorial or guide that wasn't way too basic, or way too complicated or deprecated.
